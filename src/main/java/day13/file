recursion is one of the most fundamental concepts in computer science and a key programming technique that, similarly to iteration, allows computations to be carried out repeatedly. it accomplishes t his by employing methods that invoke themselves, where the central idea consists of designing a solution to a problem by relying on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. most importantly, recursion is a powerful problem-solving approach that enables programmers to develop concise, intuitive and elegant algorithms.
